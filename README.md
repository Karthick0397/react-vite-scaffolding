#Why Vite? 
Vite is an open-source project that is designed to help developers create high-performance web applications in a faster and easier manner. 
It uses an intuitive build system and an optimized compiler to make the development process smooth and efficient. 
Vite also supports hot reloading, so developers can quickly view changes in the browser without having to restart the server. 
Additionally, it is written in TypeScript and provides a powerful plugin system that allows developers to customize the build process to their unique needs.
1.Instant Server Start
2.Lighting HMR
3.Optimized Builds

#What is SWC?
SWC (Superior Web Compiler) is a JavaScript and TypeScript compiler that converts modern JavaScript syntax into equivalent, standards-compliant JavaScript code. 
It helps developers write cleaner, more efficient code that is compatible with older browsers.

#Why do we need this Scaffolding with React Saga Boilerplat?
A person who wants to do development faster and also doesn't want to create constants, reducer, saga, actions repeatedly.

#Why SWC than Babel?
It is faster than Babel, the JavaScript compiler, and produces smaller and faster code. 
The code generated by SWC is also more optimized for modern JavaScript environments. 
Additionally, SWC is more reliable and secure than Babel, as it is written in Rust, a memory-safe language. 
In comparison, Babel is written in JavaScript, a language that is prone to security vulnerabilities.

#Why Redux Saga Boilerplate?
we are repeatedly creating constants, reducer, actions, saga whenever we want to make the API call.
We are doing the same thing again and again that will make most of the developers feel disconnected from coding.
To avoid that, we have created a Hoc for you to handle those repeated things.
