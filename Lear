#Why do we use Vite?

Vite is a modern JavaScript-based development tool for building web applications. 
It is an alternative to traditional bundlers such as Webpack and Rollup, and offers a more intuitive and faster experience for developing modern web applications. 
It uses a “zero-config” approach, meaning that developers don’t need to configure complex settings to get started. 
Instead, Vite takes care of the setup for you and provides you with a development server that hot-reloads your code as you write it.

The main advantages of using Vite over traditional bundlers are speed and simplicity.
Vite is significantly faster than other bundlers, and allows developers to quickly get up and running with their project. 
It also comes with default presets and settings, so developers don’t need to spend time and effort configuring their project everytime they start a new project.

Vite also provides a number of other useful features, such as tree-shaking and code-splitting, which can help improve the performance of web applications.

it takes JavaScript / TypeScript files using modern JavaScript features and outputs valid code that is supported by all major browsers. 
SWC is 20x faster than Babel on a single thread and 70x faster on four cores.
